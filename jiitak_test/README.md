Uses the following widgets:

🔧 Drawer Features
UnitExpansionTile
Path: lib/View/drawer/widgets/unit_expantion_tile_widget.dart

Allows the user to choose between:

metric for °C

imperial for °F

Changes trigger a new API call to update the weather data.

On exceeding 5, the earliest selected category is removed.
